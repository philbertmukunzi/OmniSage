# OmniSage: Discord LLM Chatbot

OmniSage is a versatile Discord bot that leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs) to generate intelligent responses, join voice channels, and provide text-to-speech functionality. It's designed to be your all-knowing companion in Discord servers.

**ðŸš€ Hobby Project Disclaimer ðŸ›¸**
> Warning: This bot may occasionally produce wisdom beyond human comprehension or just utter nonsense. It's a hobby project built to learn and practice LLM integration. Expect the unexpected, embrace the chaos, and don't be surprised if you find some "optimized" spaghetti code. Remember, even AI needs to let its hair down sometimes! ðŸ˜‰

## Grounding Data

(Grounding data section here)

## Troubleshooting

- If OmniSage doesn't respond, check if it has the necessary permissions in your Discord server.
- Verify that the channel or user role is in the allowed list in the `.env` file.
- For voice command issues, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
- If using Docker, ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file.
- For translation issues, make sure the LLM API is properly configured and accessible.
## Grounding Data

OmniSage supports grounding with custom data from three sources:

1. Local files
2. Amazon S3
3. Azure Blob Storage

To use grounding:

1. Set `USE_GROUNDING=true` in your `.env` file.
2. Choose the `GROUNDING_SOURCE` (local, s3, or azure) and set the corresponding configuration variables.
3. For local grounding, place your text files in the directory specified by `GROUNDING_PATH`.
4. For S3 or Azure, upload your text files to the specified bucket or container.

Use the `!reload_grounding` command to refresh OmniSage's grounding data without restarting the bot.

## Troubleshooting

- If OmniSage doesn't respond, check if it has the necessary permissions in your Discord server.
- Verify that the channel or user role is in the allowed list in the `.env` file.
- For voice command issues, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
- If using Docker, ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file.
