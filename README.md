# OmniSage: Multimodal Discord LLM Chatbot

OmniSage is a versatile Discord bot that leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs) to generate intelligent responses, join voice channels, and provide text-to-speech functionality. It's designed to be your all-knowing companion in Discord servers.

**ðŸš€ Hobby Project Disclaimer ðŸ›¸**
> Warning: This bot may occasionally produce wisdom beyond human comprehension or just utter nonsense. It's a hobby project built to learn and practice LLM integration in a fun way . Expect the unexpected, embrace the chaos, and don't be surprised if you find some "optimized" spaghetti code.ðŸ˜‰

## Grounding Data

OmniSage supports grounding with custom data from three sources:

1. Local files
2. Amazon S3
3. Azure Blob Storage

To use grounding:

1. Set `USE_GROUNDING=true` in your `.env` file.
2. Choose the `GROUNDING_SOURCE` (local, s3, or azure) and set the corresponding configuration variables.
3. For local grounding, place your text files in the directory specified by `GROUNDING_PATH`.
4. For S3 or Azure, upload your text files to the specified bucket or container.

Use the `!reload_grounding` command to refresh OmniSage's grounding data without restarting the bot.

## Troubleshooting

- If OmniSage doesn't respond, check if it has the necessary permissions in your Discord server.
- Verify that the channel or user role is in the allowed list in the `.env` file.
- For voice command issues, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
