# OmniSage: AI-Powered Discord Bot

OmniSage is a versatile Discord bot that leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs) to generate intelligent responses, join voice channels, provide text-to-speech functionality, and includes an interactive, AI-powered trivia game. It's designed to be your all-knowing companion in Discord servers.

**ðŸš€ Hobby Project Disclaimer ðŸ›¸**
> Warning: This bot may occasionally produce wisdom beyond human comprehension or just utter nonsense. It's a hobby project built to learn and practice LLM integration. Expect the unexpected, embrace the chaos, and don't be surprised if you find some "optimized" spaghetti code.  ðŸ˜‰

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

OmniSage employs a sophisticated RAG system to enhance its responses with relevant information from its knowledge base. This system combines the power of large language models with efficient information retrieval techniques.

### Key Components:

1. **LangChain**: We use LangChain, a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. LangChain provides the backbone for our RAG system, offering tools for document loading, text splitting, and chain creation.

2. **ChromaDB**: Our vector store of choice is ChromaDB, an open-source embedding database. ChromaDB allows us to efficiently store and retrieve vector representations of our knowledge base.

3. **OpenAI Embeddings**: We utilize OpenAI's text embedding model to convert text into high-dimensional vector representations. These embeddings capture semantic meanings, enabling more accurate information retrieval.

4. **Custom Text Splitter**: We implement a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to break down large documents into manageable chunks while maintaining context.

### How It Works:

1. **Document Ingestion**: When grounding data is loaded, each document is split into smaller chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk is then converted into a vector embedding using OpenAI's embedding model.

3. **Vector Storage**: These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB along with metadata about their source.

4. **Query Processing**: When a user query comes in, it's also converted to an embedding.

5. **Similarity Search**: The system performs a similarity search in ChromaDB to find the most relevant chunks of information.

6. **Context-Enhanced Generation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the prompt sent to the language model, allowing it to generate more informed and accurate responses.

7. **Source Attribution**: The bot can provide information about the sources of its knowledge, increasing transparency and trustworthiness.

This RAG system allows OmniSage to leverage its extensive knowledge base effectively, providing responses that are both contextually relevant and factually grounded.

### Custom Knowledge Grounding

OmniSage's knowledge can be enhanced with custom data, truly embracing the BYOD (Bring Your Own Data) concept.

- **Multiple Data Sources**: 
  - Local files (.txt and .docx)
  - Amazon S3
  - Azure Blob Storage

- **Dynamic Reloading**: Grounding data can be reloaded without restarting the bot, allowing for real-time knowledge updates.

- **Detailed Logging**: The grounding process is accompanied by comprehensive logging, providing insights into the data loading and processing steps.

- **Improved Chunking and Metadata**: 
  - Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for intelligent text splitting
  - Chunk size: 300 characters
  - Chunk overlap: 100 characters
  - Metadata includes source filename and start index for precise attribution

- **Flexible File Handling**: The system attempts multiple encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, ASCII) when reading files, increasing compatibility with various file formats.



## Planned Features

1. **Multi-Model Support**: Extend OmniSage's capabilities to use multiple models.

2. **Custom Personality Profiles**: Allow server admins to customize OmniSage's personality and behavior for their specific community needs.

3. **Integration with External APIs**: Connect OmniSage to various external APIs liek Slack and Teams.

4. **Advanced Conversation Memory**: Implement long-term memory storage to remember user preferences and past interactions across sessions.

5. **Voice Recognition**: Add the ability for OmniSage to understand voice commands in voice channels.

6. **Interactive Tutorials**: Create interactive tutorials to help new users learn how to use OmniSage effectively.

7. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement sentiment analysis to allow OmniSage to better understand and respond to user emotions.

8. **Role-play Modes**: Add specific role-play modes where OmniSage can act as different characters or entities.

9. **Customizable Command Creation**: Allow admins to create custom commands specific to their server needs.

10. **Integration with Server Events**: Enable OmniSage to manage and interact with Discord server events.

11. **Data Visualization**: Implement the ability to generate and share graphs or charts based on conversational data or external information.

12. **Scheduled Messages**: Allow users to schedule messages or reminders through OmniSage.

## Grounding Data

(Grounding data section here)

## Troubleshooting

- If OmniSage doesn't respond, check if it has the necessary permissions in your Discord server.
- Verify that the channel or user role is in the allowed list in the `.env` file.
- For voice command issues, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
- If using Docker, ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file.
- For translation issues, make sure the LLM API is properly configured and accessible.

## Grounding Data

OmniSage supports grounding with custom data from three sources:

1. Local files (.txt and .docx)
2. Amazon S3
3. Azure Blob Storage

To use grounding:

1. Set `USE_GROUNDING=true` in your `.env` file.
2. Choose the `GROUNDING_SOURCE` (local, s3, or azure) and set the corresponding configuration variables.
3. For local grounding, place your text files in the directory specified by `GROUNDING_PATH`.
4. For S3 or Azure, upload your text files to the specified bucket or container.

The grounding system now uses improved chunking and metadata for more relevant information retrieval. The bot will mention the source of information in its responses when using grounded knowledge.

Use the `!reload_grounding` command to refresh OmniSage's grounding data without restarting the bot.

## Troubleshooting

- If OmniSage doesn't respond, check if it has the necessary permissions in your Discord server.
- Verify that the channel or user role is in the allowed list in the `.env` file.
- For voice command issues, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible.
- Check the console output for any error messages.
- If using Docker, ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file.
- For grounding issues, verify that your grounding files are in the correct format (.txt or .docx) and the `GROUNDING_PATH` is set correctly.
- If encountering encoding errors with grounding files, ensure they are in UTF-8 encoding or update the `read_file_with_fallback_encoding` function in `grounding_utils.py` to include the correct encoding.
